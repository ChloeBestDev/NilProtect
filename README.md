# NilProtect - Advanced anti-cheat solution for Minecraft.

## About
NilProtect is a new anticheat made for Minecraft Spigot 1.8 servers.

## Features
Mitigation - NilProtect mitigates cheaters in many different ways to ensure an advantage is not given. For example, autoblocking will result in damage being half of normal.

Prediction - This project is based on Grim, which has a 1:1 prediction engine. This essentially prevents most movement exploits/cheats.

NilProtect can also be used on servers with many players without issues.
